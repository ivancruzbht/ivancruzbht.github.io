I am trying octopress. In my last post, I showed you how to set up Octopress and install a much better theme. In this post, I show you how to customize that theme to your tastes.

Now whitepress is a great theme in itself, but maybe you think the font is too small, or too big. Or that the colors are wrong, or maybe you want a different font altogether. Thankfully, changing these things isn’t too hard with Octopress.

First of all, you’ll want to copy the whitepress theme into a different folder, so you can go back to plain old whitepress if you need or want to. This will be in octopress/.themes/whitepress. You can copy it to another folder inside .themes, I’ll call it sunlab. Now you can install your copy of the theme.
