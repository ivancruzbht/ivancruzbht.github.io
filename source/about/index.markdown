My name is Iv√°n Omar (IO) Cruz ("cross" or "X" in spanish), hence io-x. Clever uh? I know that an "X" is technically a saltire so don't get too picky. 

I enjoy learning whatever I can. I mainly study stuff related to natural language processing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, opinion mining and data science. I know a little bit of CS in general.

I am the founder of <a href="http://sentimentdynamics.com">sentimentdynamics.com</a>. It is an API for opinion mining. Go and check it out!

I got a MSc in Computer Science and a BS in Communications and Electronics. I'm thinking if it is a good idea to get a PhD. I don't know yet if the academia life style is what I want. In the meantime, I mantain this blog trying to keep my researching and writing skills sharp.

I do software engineering. Right now as freelance. I got many years of experience in tech companies on my back. I did mainly backend software and midware. A little bit of mobile software from time to time.

I practice karate (shito-ryu style). I play the piano a little bit and I like to make <a href="https://soundcloud.com/iomusix">music</a>. I know and can do a lot of other stuff (e.g. I can cook the best french fucking toasts!; I can also do origami; I kinda speak 3 languages; I am a god at Dota2, etc etc etc). But that is material for another blog.

Feel free to contact me if you have the interest!
